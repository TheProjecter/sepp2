= Introduction =

    Sepp2's name come from this idea of "Secret-information Exchanging for Point to Point".But why there should be a more number of "2" after it. That's the worries I am thinking.
    This software product is coming from basic instinct of me. For years, I have been developing it in my spare time. Now this product I made is mature,and now I want to promote on the Internet. For years, I named it as "sepp".But now, I have found there are other projects named "sepp" on Internet. In order to avoid misunderstanding or law issues, I am willing to add "2" after sepp. But in source codes of "sepp2", I still want to use the name "sepp", because I like this name of "sepp".Anyway that is the way that how I name this project as "sepp2".
